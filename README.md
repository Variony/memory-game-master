# Memory Game Project

## What is this project?

The Memory Game Project is all about demonstrating mastery of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## How it works?

Each turn:

* The player flips one card over to reveal its underlying symbol.
* The player then turns over a second card, trying to find the corresponding card with the same symbol.
* If the cards match, both cards stay flipped over.
* If the cards do not match, both cards are flipped face down.
* The game ends once all cards have been correctly matched.

## Used library and Framework
* Flexbox
* jQuery
